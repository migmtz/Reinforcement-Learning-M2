# Reinforcement-Learning-M2
Reinforcement Learning codes from M2

This repository contains the different codes used for the course of RLD (Reinforcement Learning and Advanced Deep Learning) during my second year of Master's degree in Sorbonnne UniversitÃ©, Algorithmes et Apprentissage (M2A).

The different environments can be found in the environments folder, usually using tradition RL environments. 

The agents folder contains the many different agents coded for every project (10 in total).

Information can be found in -> http://dac.lip6.fr/master/rladl/

Feel free to contact me for any mistake you might find or if you have any question.
